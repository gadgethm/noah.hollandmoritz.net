***Hi!  I'm Noah.***  
I'm currently a student at the University of Colorado Boulder, studying Engineering Physics, Computer Science, and Astronomy.  You can check out some of my projects [here](#projects).

I am a big fan of all things space.  I'm currently working for the [Colorado Space Grant Consortium](http://spacegrant.colorado.edu/) on one of their cubesats, called [PolarCube](http://spacegrant.colorado.edu/boulderstudents/boulderprojects/allstar/polarcube).  

In my spare time, I practice aikido and perform in an improvisational comedy group, called [Damage Control](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DamageControlImprov/).  I love to work with my hands and make things, as well as go skiing, hiking, biking, and taking pictures of cool people and places.  I also occasionally like to code things, like this website.  Take a look around here to find out more, and feel free to drop me a line on my [contact](#contact) page!

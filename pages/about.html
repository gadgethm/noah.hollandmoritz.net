<p><strong><em>Hi!  I’m Noah.</em></strong><br />
I’m currently a student at the University of Colorado Boulder, studying Engineering Physics, Computer Science, and Astronomy.  You can check out some of my projects <a href="#projects">here</a>.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of all things space.  I’m currently working for the <a href="http://spacegrant.colorado.edu/">Colorado Space Grant Consortium</a> on one of their cubesats, called <a href="http://spacegrant.colorado.edu/boulderstudents/boulderprojects/allstar/polarcube">PolarCube</a>.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I practice aikido and perform in an improvisational comedy group, called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/DamageControlImprov/">Damage Control</a>.  I love to work with my hands and make things, as well as go skiing, hiking, biking, and taking pictures of cool people and places.  I also occasionally like to code things, like this website.  Take a look around here to find out more, and feel free to drop me a line on my <a href="#contact">contact</a> page!</p>

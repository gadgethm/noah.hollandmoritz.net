# Personal Webpage/Portfolio

Hi, my name is Noah Holland-Moritz, and you've reached the github page for my website!  I originally created this site as part of the requirements for my school's [Engineering Honors Program](http://www.cuhonorsengineering.com/).  Now it serves as my personal webpage.  Feel free to use my code for your own nefarious purposes, and contact me if you are having trouble setting it up and want some pointers.  Cheers!

This website uses a Jekyll version of the "Dimension" theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/), made by [Andrew Banchich](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/dimension-jekyll-theme)

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)

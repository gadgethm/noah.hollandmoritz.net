##### Programming Languages and Tools 
I have extensive experience writing code in C, C++, CSS/HTML, Python, Ruby, and Bash.  I also have some experience with Assembly, Java, and R.  As part of these experiences I learned how to effectively use GDB debugging, Unix operating systems, and git.  

##### Software Packages
I've used many industry standard software packages, including MATLAB, SolidWorks, Mathematica, Altium, and Code Composer.  As a result, I have experience with mechanical and electrical design, as well as low level coding and programming mathematical analysis tools.  

##### Other Skills
I have extensive manual machining experience, including lathe, mill, band saw, sheet metal tools, tapping, surface mount soldering, chip reflowing, 3D printing, laser cutting, and some limited CNC.

<p>I'm a recently graduated student of <a href="http://www.colorado.edu">University of Colorado</a>, majoring in Engineering Physics.  I currently work as an electrical test engineer at <a href="http://www.bluecanyontech.com">Blue Canyon Technologies</a> developing satellite hardware. In my spare time, I like to take photos, look up at the stars and <a href="/project">make things</a>. I also enjoy hiking, mountain biking, skiing, and backpacking!</p>
